# Culver's Ice Cream iCal

TODO: Hosting Link / Build Badge

## Introduction

Generate a custom Culver's Flavor of the Day iCal feed.

## Summary

The [Culver's](https://www.culvers.com "Culver's") website lets you view the Flavor of the Day for a specific location and export individual days as iCal files. However, it doesn't let you generate an iCal feed for that location, reference multiple locations at once, or filter by flavor(s).

This tool bridges that gap. It offers an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org "OpenAPI")-compliant interface that offers endpoints to do the following:

* Search for store locations, and get details about a specific one.
* Search for flavors, and get details about a specific one.
* Generate an iCal feed for one or more store locations, and optionally filter by flavor(s).

This tool is not endorsed by, or associated with, Culver's in any way. It makes use of publically available data, and caches that data to be a good network citizen. I, and my wife, are just fans of Culver's ice cream. üòçüç®üç¶
